# **App Name**: StudyVerse

## Core Features:

- Password Protection: Implement an entry password screen using a hardcoded password.
- Username Authentication: Require users to enter a unique username for login.
- Subject Organization: Display a dashboard organized by subject folders: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science, English Language, Business Studies, Economics, Accounts.
- File Sharing: Allow users to upload and download study materials with file previews or names.
- AI StudyBot Interface: Simulate StudyBot conversations by returning dummy responses, so that we can test the user interface for question asking. The StudyBot is implemented as a tool. It can decide to answer immediately, to delay answering, or not to answer. The history of local user questions and bot "replies" is preserved and displayed.
- Real-Time Chat: Implement a real-time public chat visible to all users.  Messages will show the sender's username, and support emojis and multi-line inputs.
- Responsive Layout: Create a responsive design layout optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 60%, 50%) which converts to a hex value of #478EFF for a bright and engaging blue.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) which converts to a hex value of #F0F4FF, creating a calm, light backdrop.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 50%, 50%) which converts to a hex value of #40BFBF, a contrasting teal to draw attention to interactive elements.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used for all body text, which promotes readability. Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font, will be used for headings, as its modern, tech-driven style aligns well with the app's content.
- Employ a consistent set of minimalist icons for subjects and actions to facilitate intuitive navigation.
- Design a clear and structured layout with a sidebar for subject navigation, a main panel for content display, and a right panel for StudyBot and chat.
- Implement subtle animations on interactions and data loading to enhance user experience without being distracting.
